3. System Features  
3.1 Face Detection and Tracking   
Face detection is a high -priority feature that  serves as the foundation of the monitoring system by 
continuously tracking whether a student's face is visible in the webcam feed, thus enabling presence 
monitoring. When a student positions their face in front of the webcam, the system detects and begins  
tracking it; if the student moves away, the system registers the absence and triggers an alert after a 
configurable time threshold. Functionally, the system is designed to detect human faces in real -time, 
distinguish between presence and absence, and main tain tracking even during minor movements. It is 
optimized to operate under various lighting conditions and is capable of generating absence alerts after a 
default threshold of 30 seconds, while also recording timestamps for all face detection events.  
  
3.2 Eye Tracking for Drowsiness Detection  
Eye tracking is a high -priority component of the system that monitors students’ eye status to detect signs of 
drowsiness by calculating the eye aspect ratio (EAR) and analyzing blink patterns. When a student blinks 
normally, the system records the pattern without triggering any alerts. However, if the student’s eyes remain 
closed or nearly closed for an extended period, the system detects a reduced EAR and generates a 
drowsiness alert. The system is capable of detecti ng and tracking eye landmarks in real -time, distinguishing 
between normal blinking and prolonged eye closure. It generates alerts after a configurable threshold, with a 
default of 3 seconds, and logs timestamps and durations of drowsiness events. Additiona lly, it is designed to 
function accurately even when users are wearing standard glasses.  
 
3.3 Head Pose Estimation  
Head pose estimation is a medium -priority feature that helps determine whether students are paying 
attention to the screen or are distracted by looking elsewhere. When a student looks directly at the screen, 
the system records them as attentive; however, if the student turns their head away, the system detects the 
change in head orientation and triggers a distraction alert after a configurable threshold, typically set to 5 
seconds. The system estimates head orientation using facial landmarks and calculates the pitch, yaw, and roll 
angles to determine the student’s focus direction. It tracks head movements in 3D space and records 
timestamps along  with the direction of movement for monitoring and analysis.  
 
3.4 Alerting System  
The alerting system is a high -priority component designed to notify users in real -time about behavioral 
issues such as drowsiness, distraction, or absence. When such an issue  is detected, the system generates a

Governmen t College University  Faisalabad                                                                                                                   page 7  
 
corresponding alert with an appropriate severity level. Once the user acknowledges the alert, it is marked as 
resolved. The system supports real -time alert generation, categorizes alerts by type and severity, and 
displa ys visual indicators for active alerts. It also maintains a history of alerts for each monitoring session, 
allows customization of alert thresholds, and provides users with the ability to acknowledge and dismiss 
alerts as needed.  
 
3.5 Session Management   
Session management is a high -priority feature that handles the creation, tracking, and control of monitoring 
sessions. When a user initiates a session, the system starts monitoring and logs the session details. Upon 
ending the session, the system finalizes the data and generates a summary. It supports tracking session 
duration and status, linking alerts and events to specific sessions, and calculating session -based statistics. 
Users can pause, resume, or end sessions, reset session stats, and access or delet e past session records, 
ensuring flexibility and comprehensive monitoring control.  
 
3.6 Reporting and Analytics  
The reporting and analytics module is a medium -priority feature designed to offer insights into student 
behavior through detailed statistics and  visualizations. When users request reports, the system generates 
session summaries including attention scores, alert distributions, and behavior trends over time. Users can 
apply filters such as date range and alert type to refine the data. The system vis ualizes session data, 
calculates averages, and presents a detailed event timeline, enabling instructors and administrators to assess 
engagement and identify patterns effectively.

The system interfaces with several software components to ensure smooth operation. It supports modern 
web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, requiring WebRTC for camera access, JavaScript for 
dynamic features, and local storage or session storage to mai ntain session state.  
The backend is developed using Node.js with the Express.js framework, offering RESTful API 
communication via JSON. Data is stored in MongoDB using Mongoose ORM with connection pooling for 
performance. The AI module operates as a Pyth on-based  Flask or FastAPI microservice.  
Computer vision tasks rely on OpenCV and Dlib libraries for face, eye, and head pose detection. The 
frontend visualizations are implemented using Chart.js, while Axios handles API communication. Socket.IO 
is used fo r real -time bi -directional alert delivery between client and server.  
 
4.4 Communication Interfaces   
The system uses several communication interfaces to ensure secure and efficient data exchange. All client -
server communication occurs over secure HTTPS usin g RESTful API endpoints with session -based 
authentication. WebRTC enables real -time webcam access by directly capturing video streams within the 
browser without server relay. WebSockets may be used optionally for instant, bidirectional alerts and 
notificat ions between client and server. Database connections to PostgreSQL are secured and optimized with 
connection pooling. Additionally, all communication is encrypted with TLS/SSL to protect data privacy and 
security.

5. Nonfunctional Requirements   
5.1 Perform ance Requirements  
The system is designed to meet key performance requirements across various dimensions. User interface 
actions should respond within 1 second, while face detection must process frames in under 100 milliseconds, 
and alerts should be generat ed within 3 seconds of issue detection. The system must support real -time 
webcam processing at a minimum of 15 frames per second and handle at least 100 database transactions per 
minute. It should accommodate at least 50 concurrent users per server instanc e and store up to 1,000 
monitoring sessions per user, with the database capable of holding over 1 million alert records. On the client 
side, memory usage should stay below 500MB, CPU utilization under 50% on average systems, and 
bandwidth use should not ex ceed 1 Mbps per active session. The architecture must support horizontal 
scaling to handle increasing user load, and the database should be optimized for managing large datasets 
efficiently.  
 
5.2 Safety Requirements  
The system incorporates several importan t safety considerations to ensure a secure and supportive user 
experience. For psychological safety, it avoids excessive or overly intrusive monitoring that might lead to 
student anxiety, clearly indicates when monitoring is active, and includes features t o reduce “surveillance 
fatigue.” In terms of physical safety, the system issues warnings to help prevent eye strain, enforces session 
time limits with recommended breaks, and offers guidance for proper ergonomic workstation setup. To 
protect data safety, t he system performs regular backups, includes mechanisms for data recovery, and uses 
transaction management techniques to prevent data corruption.  
 
5.3 Security Requirements   
The system incorporates robust security measures across multiple areas. For authen tication, it uses strong  
password hashing (e.g., BCrypt), supports optional multi -factor authentication, enforces account lockouts 
after repeated failed logins, and includes session timeouts after inactivity. Data security is ensured through 
encryption at  rest and in transit using TLS/SSL, along with regular security audits and adherence to the 
principle of least privilege. Privacy protections include compliance with data regulations, clear privacy  
policies, user control over data deletion, and anonymizat ion for analytics. Application -level security 
addresses OWASP Top 10 threats, with input validation, secure API authentication, and regular updates and 
patches.
